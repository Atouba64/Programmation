Python Programming Course
=========================

About
-----

These are the lecture notes I used to teach an optional 5-week 
Python Programming course to 2nd-year Math/Physics/Astronomy 
undergraduates at the University of Hertfordshire. 

Preview
-------

You can see a compiled version of the notes [on my website](http://star.herts.ac.uk/~gb/python/).

Usage
-----

To edit the lectures, go to the lectures subdirectory and start the ipython notebook server:

    ipython notebook

When you have finished editing the lectures, you can automatically generate static HTML files and slides from the ipython notebook files by using:

    python setup.py build

This course is based, for a significant part, on an existing course called 
"Python: Programming for Scientists" by Thomas Robitaille,

In addition, some course material on scipy and sympy has been adapted from:
