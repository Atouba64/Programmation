Python Programming Course
=========================

About
-----
These are the lecture notes I used to teach a 10-week 
Python Programming course to MSc (astro)physics students
at the University of Hertfordshire. 

Preview
-------
You can see a compiled version of the notes [on my website](http://star.herts.ac.uk/~gb/python/).

Usage
-----
To edit the lectures, go to the lectures subdirectory and start the ipython notebook server:

```
ipython notebook
```

When you have finished editing the lectures, you can automatically generate static HTML files and slides from the ipython notebook files using:

```
python setup.py build
```
